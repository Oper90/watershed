# Introduction to Coding

What is programming?

## Discussion    
1. Where in the everyday world one can see programming?
2. What would happen if computers disappeared?
3. What will happen in the future as computers get smaller, faster, and cheaper?
4. Look up the history of the printing press and how cheap paper manufacturing
radically changed access to reading and writing across economic classes. Can you see any parallels to programming and our modern society?
